First, synthesize key facts from this article that would make good quiz questions:

Article Title: {{ title }}
Content: {{ content }}

Then, generate 4 multiple choice trivia questions based on the synthesized facts.
Format the response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "questions": [
        {
            "text": "question text",
            "answers": [
                {"text": "answer 1", "is_correct": true},
                {"text": "answer 2", "is_correct": false},
                {"text": "answer 3", "is_correct": false},
                {"text": "answer 4", "is_correct": false}
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Make sure the questions:
1. Are interesting and vary in difficulty
2. Have answers that are similar in length
3. Use straightforward language
4. Maintain key terms and concepts
5. Have randomized answer orders
