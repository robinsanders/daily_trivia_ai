Debugging Report: Frontend Blank Screen Issue
Date: February 8, 2025

BACKGROUND:
- Project: Daily Trivia AI
- Technology Stack: Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL
- Initial State: Frontend showing blank screen
- Environment: Dockerized application with web service and database

CHALLENGE:
The frontend of the application was inaccessible, showing a blank screen when attempting to access it. The issue needed to be diagnosed and resolved through systematic debugging of both the application configuration and code.

ACTIONS TAKEN AND RESOLUTION:

1. Initial Frontend Investigation
   - Examined frontend template files (base.html, index.html)
   - Added error handling and console logging to JavaScript
   - Improved CSS styling for visibility
   - Result: Page still blank, suggesting deeper infrastructure issue

2. Application Server Investigation
   - Attempted to run Flask application directly
   - Discovered missing dependencies (flask-login)
   - Verified requirements.txt contained all necessary packages
   - Result: Identified need to use Docker for consistent environment

3. Docker Configuration Analysis
   - Examined Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
   - Verified correct port mapping (5000->5001)
   - Confirmed all services properly defined
   - Result: Docker configuration correct but application still inaccessible

4. Network Binding Resolution
   - Identified root cause: Flask binding to localhost inside container
   - Modified app.py to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Rebuilt and restarted containers
   - Result: Application successfully accessible at http://localhost:5001

SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME:
The application became accessible after changing Flask's binding configuration to listen on all interfaces instead of just localhost. This allowed the containerized application to properly expose its web interface to the host machine.

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. Container networking requires proper interface binding
2. Development server configuration differs when running in containers
3. Systematic debugging approach helps identify root causes
4. Docker environment setup is crucial for consistent application behavior

Status: RESOLVED
Access Point: http://localhost:5001
